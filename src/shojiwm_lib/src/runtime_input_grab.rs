//! `COMPOSITOR.input.grab()`: while a config holds a grab, keyboard, pointer
//! button, scroll and swipe input goes to the config instead of the clients.
//!
//! The grab is modal and takes everything: there is no per-event "pass
//! through" answer, so input never waits on the runtime to decide where it
//! goes. Pointer motion still moves the cursor; clients just lose pointer
//! focus for the duration. Keys held when the grab starts keep delivering
//! their release to the client that saw the press, so a modifier held to open
//! the grab (`Super+Tab`) is not left stuck down in the focused window.
//!
//! The compositor drops the grab on its own when the screen locks, when the
//! config reloads, and when the runtime fails to handle a grab event, so a
//! broken config can never keep the desktop unreachable.
